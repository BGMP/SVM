SVM
===
A really simple implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, which is an effective tool for solving
classification and regression problems in machine learning.

This project was written as part of the Masters in Computer Science course "Advanced Topics on Databases" at the
University of the Bío-Bío.

## Running
To run the program, first install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Dependencies
### Python
- [Python 3.8 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Python modules:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
- I suggest using venv & pip for development & dependency management. (In case of Apple Silicon use conda)
